- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dominik Gawlik, Software Developer from Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently I'm following new trends in JVM, Go and JavaScript.

Here are highlights of my repositories:

### JavaParsec

[link](https://github.com/dgawlik/JavaParsec])

I experimented a lot with Haskell in 2025 and expecially liked the experience of writing parsers with Parsec. This library
tries to mimick doing fast iterations on combinators with JBang and Java24 implicit class main files. It is a self contained
collection of parser combinators ready to use on advanced use cases. Check out the examples directory.

### GoIoc

[https://github.com/dgawlik/go-ioc](link)

Dependency Injection container for Go, doing injection based on type aliases.

### Spiral

Translation of idea (from Kakoune editor) of selecting and moving cursor in one time in VSCode plugin.

### Octapus

[https://github.com/dgawlik/octopus](link)]

Modelling concurrency issues by auto-ennumerating all concurrent runs, with pretty printing.
