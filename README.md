ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dominik Gawlik, Software Developer from Germany.

ðŸ’» At work I do backend stuff on JVM. After work I experiment with new technologies.

ðŸ‘€ Currently I'm following trends in Software and preparing to write own toy language.

Check out my hobby projects:

### JavaParsec

[link](https://github.com/dgawlik/JavaParsec])

I learned Haskell on intermediate level in 2025 it was partly painful partly fun. I wanted to bring this experience to Java so this library
tries be REPL friendly and mimick doing fast iterations on parser combinators with JBang and Java24 implicit class main files. It is a self contained
collection of parser functions ready to be used on advanced use cases. Check out the examples directory.
